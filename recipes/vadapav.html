      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Spicy Potato Filling Sandwitched between burger buns known as Pav</h3>
      <p>A popular Indian street food recipe prepared mainly with pav bread and deep-fried batata vada stuffing. Most commonly, this snack is also referred to as Indian burger or Bombay burger because it hails from Maharashtra or Marathi cuisine.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> 2 Tbsp oil</li>
      <li> 1/4 tsp hing</li>
      <li> 1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
      <li> 2 tsp saunf</li>
      <li> 1 onion</li>
      <li> 2 tsp green chilli - garlic paste</li>
      <li> 2 nos potato, boiled</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li> 2 tsp coriander leaves</li>
      <li> 2 tsp lemon juice</li>
      <li> 4 Green chillies </li>
      <li> 1/2 kg Besan </li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p><li>Boil 2 large potatoes that weigh about 350 grams. Peel and then mash them with a fork in a bowl.</li>
  <li>You can boil or steam the potatoes in a pan, Instant pot or pressure cooker. Remember to drain the water very well from the boiled potatoes before you mash them.</li>
  <li>Also crush 6 to 7 small/medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 to 2 green chilies in a mortar pestle.</li></p>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Mix everything well. Then make small to medium balls from the mashed potato mixture. Flatten these balls a bit. Cover and keep aside.</p>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p> In another bowl, make a smooth batter from 1 to 1.25 cups besan (gram flour), ⅛ teaspoon turmeric powder (about 2 to 3 pinches), a pinch of asafoetida (hing), a pinch of baking soda (optional), salt and ½ cup water or as needed.The batter should have a medium-thick flowing consistency. It should not be too thick or thin. If the batter becomes thin, add 1 or 2 tablespoons of gram flour. If the batter becomes thick, then add 1 or 2 tablespoons of water.</p>
  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p> Before you dip the batata vada in the batter, heat oil in a pan or wok (kadai). When the oil becomes hot then dip the batata vada in the batter to coat as shown in the above steps.Carefully and gently drop these batter coated potato balls in medium hot oil.</p>
  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>Serve them when they are still hot or warm. Put all the chutneys and pav on your work surface. Slice the pav without breaking it into two parts and set aside.If you don’t have sweet chutney, then make the vada pav with green chutney. The green chutney and sweet chutney recipes are in the recipe card below.You can make these two chutney recipes some hours ahead or a day before and refrigerate.</p>
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>Serve vada pav immediately or else the pav becomes soggy. You can also serve some salted fried green chilies and both of the chutneys with it.It makes for a good filling evening snack high on carbs. A cup of hot tea or coffee can also be served as a side beverage.</p>
