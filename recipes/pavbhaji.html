      <h2>Description</h2>
      <h3>Spicy Bhaji with decoration of onion and coriander leaves with butter on bhaji and pav fried with butter on pan.</h3>
      <p>Pav bhaji is an iconic dish from Mumbai, which is also hugely popular as street food all over India. It first came into picture in Mumbai as a quick lunch option for textile mill workers.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
      <li> Mixed Vegetables</li>
      <li> Green Peas</li>
      <li> Pav Bhaji Masala</li>
      <li> Butter</li>
      <li> Onions</li>
      <li> 2 tsp green chilli - garlic paste</li>
      <li> Pav</li>
      <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li> 2 tsp coriander leaves</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <p>Rinse, peel and chop the veggies. You will need 1 cup chopped cauliflower, 1 cup chopped carrot, 3 medium sized potatoes (chopped) and â…“ cup chopped french beans.</p>
  <p>Cabbage, broccoli, zucchini, pumpkin are some unique options that you can consider to add, but the traditional version does not include these veggies.</p>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <p>Add all the above chopped veggies in a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen).I have cooked the veggies in a pressure cooker. You can boil or steam them using a pan or in the Instant pot adding water as needed.</p>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  <p> Add 2.25 to 2.5 cups water.Pressure cook the veggies for 5 to 6 whistles or for about 12 minutes on medium heat.</p>
  <h3>Step 4</h3>
  <p> When the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker and check if the veggies are fork tender, softened and cooked well.</p>
  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  <p>Heat a frying pan or kadai (wok). You can also use a large tawa or a skillet. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter. You can use amul butter or any brand of butter. The butter can be salted or unsalted.</p>
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  <p>Add 2 to 3 tablespoons Pav bhaji Masala Powder. Depending on how instense is the aroma and flavor of pav bhaji masala, you can add it in less or more proportions.Add 2 tablespoons if the pav bhaji masala is strong, intense and flavorful. For a more robust and spiced bhaji add 3 tablespoons of it.</p>
  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  <p>Add the cooked veggies. You can choose to mash the veggies before you add them in the pan or skillet.</p>
  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  <p>You can mash the veggies less or more according to the consistency you want in the bhaji. For a smooth mixture mash more. For a chunky bhaji, mash less. Add more water if the bhaji looks thick.</p>
  <h3>Step 9</h3>
  <p>Do stir often so that the bhaji does not stick to the pan. When the bhaji simmers to the desired consistency, check the taste.Add salt, pav bhaji masala, red chili powder or butter if needed.</p>
  <h3>Step 10</h3>
  <p>When the butter begins to melt, add 1 teaspoon of pav bhaji masala (for 2 to 3 pav). You can skip pav bhaji masala if you prefer.</p>
  <h3>Step 11</h3>
  <p>Now turn over the pav. Press gently with a spatula and rotate them on the tawa so that the second side absorbs the butter. Add more butter if needed. You can turn over and toast them more if required. Then transfer the lightly pan fried bread rolls in a plate and set aside. This way fry the rolls in two to three batches.</p>
